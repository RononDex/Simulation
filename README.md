Simulation
==========

An abstract multi threading enabled simulation Framework for C# that can be used to model / simulate almost everything.

What is this?
---------------
The Simulation Framework is a sophisticated tool to write simulations and models. It can be used to simulate anything you can imagine from a simple GameEngine for a game or fully simulated scientific models / simulations.

This framework was written by me during my physics studies with the idea in mind I might be able to use it in the future.

How do I use it?
---------------
There is currently no documentation. However the code should be self-explanatory in most cases. Documentation will follow as soon as I get time to do it. To get started take a look into the "Simulation.Testing" folder. It contains a small console application to demonstrate its usage.

How can I contribute?
---------------
You can contribute by telling me about bugs / feature requests you got.
Also you can fork it and make a push request to this main distro.
